# Refactor Job

## Metadata (Required)
- Issue/Task ID:
- Short Title:
- Run Folder Name:            # REQUIRED (e.g. issue-0016-refactor-debug-cleanup)
- Job Type: refactor
- Author (human):
- Date:

---

## Goal
Describe the structural improvement being made and why.
No behavior change.

---

## Non-Goals
- No gameplay changes.
- No feature additions.
- No behavior changes beyond structure/readability.

---

## Invariants (Must Remain True)
- Time advances only via `GameState.advance_time(reason)`.
- Docked UI interactions do not advance time.
- GameState remains authoritative for transitions.
- UI does not mutate state directly.
- Economy determinism remains keyed by `(system_id, tick, market_kind)`.

Add job-specific invariants here if needed.

---

## Scope

### Files Allowed to Modify (Whitelist)
-
-

### Files Forbidden to Modify (Blacklist)
- `data/**`
- `scenes/MainGame.tscn`

---

## Approach (High Level)
1) Describe structural cleanup or consolidation.
2) Describe how call sites are updated.
3) Describe how behavior equivalence is preserved.

---

## Verification

### Manual Test Steps
1.
2.

### Regression Checklist
- [ ] No UI action advances time
- [ ] No state mutation moved into UI
- [ ] Logs still reflect real player actions
- [ ] No protected paths touched

## Git Preflight Gate (Mandatory)
Before ANY code changes, Codex must run and report:

- `git branch --show-current`
- `git status --short`
- `git log --oneline -n 5 --decorate`
- `git show HEAD:codex/runs/ACTIVE_RUN.txt`
- `git fetch origin`
- `git status -sb`
- Preferred wrapper: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File codex/tools/git_gates.ps1 -Mode Preflight`

Rules:
- If `git status --short` is not empty (modified OR untracked files), Codex MUST STOP and ask the user to choose ONE:
  A) Stash WIP (must include untracked): `git stash push -u -m "wip: <short description>"`
  B) Run the current issue’s Closeout Gate (stage → staged diff review → commit → push)
- If `git status -sb` shows the branch is behind origin (e.g. `[behind N]`), Codex MUST STOP and instruct `git pull --ff-only` (or stash-or-closeout first if the tree is dirty).
- Codex must not proceed with any implementation until the working tree is clean AND the branch is not behind origin.

## Git Postflight & Closeout Gate (Mandatory)
After implementation is complete, Codex must perform these gates in order:

1) Review Gate (Staged Diff)
- Stage ONLY:
  - `codex/runs/ACTIVE_RUN.txt`
  - `codex/runs/<Run Folder Name>/**`
  - Whitelisted files for this job
- Then show:
  - `git diff --stat --staged`
  - `git diff --staged`
- STOP and wait for the user’s explicit approval.

2) Closeout Gate (Commit + Push)
- Only after the user replies exactly: “Green light: commit and push”
- Run:
  - `git commit -m "<Issue/Task ID>: <Short Title>"`
  - `git push --porcelain`
- Then show proof:
  - `git log --oneline -n 3`
  - `git show HEAD:codex/runs/ACTIVE_RUN.txt`
  - `git status --short` (must be clean)
- STOP.

---
## Codex Scaffolding & Output Requirements (Mandatory)

Codex must perform the following before any code changes:

1) Create `codex/runs/<Run Folder Name>/`
2) Write this job verbatim to `codex/runs/<Run Folder Name>/job.md`
3) Create `codex/runs/<Run Folder Name>/results.md` if missing
4) Write `codex/runs/ACTIVE_RUN.txt` = `<Run Folder Name>`

Codex must write final results only to:
- `codex/runs/<Run Folder Name>/results.md`

Results must include:
- Summary of refactor
- Files changed
- Manual test results
- Confirmation behavior is unchanged
- Follow-ups / known gaps (if any)

## Migration Notes
None.

## Logging Checklist
- [ ] No debug spam added
- [ ] No meaningful logs removed
- [ ] `print()` removed or debug-only
- [ ] Log volume appropriate
